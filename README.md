## Object Detection
Object detection is a critical capability of computer vision that identifies and locates objects within an image or video. Unlike image classification, object detection not only classifies the objects in an image, but also identifies their location within the image by drawing a bounding box around each object.

## about the project
This is a deep learning application that detects the common objects using the YOLO algorithm. 

## run locally:

#### 1. clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/haripajjuri/Real-time-object-detection.git
```
```
cd Real-time-object-detection
```


#### 2. create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv <name of venv>
```


#### 3. activate the venv
```
<name of venv>\Scripts\activae
```


#### 4. install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### 5. run the script
